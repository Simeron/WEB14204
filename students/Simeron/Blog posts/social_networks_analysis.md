### Audience(s)

Write your observations about the competitors' audience(s). Who is this network for, primarily and secondarily?


### Relationship(s)

What kind of relationships (aka *ties*) can users (aka *nodes*) establish in the network? 

What are the steps to connect (and disconnect)? What are these actions called (see *content definition* below)?

#### Reciprocity

How do people *reciprocate* the relationships they establish on these networks? For example on Facebook you have to reciprocate (ie "I am your friend and you are my friend"), on Twitter you don't ("You follow me, but I don't follow you")

#### Homophily

To what extent do people form ties with similar versus dissimilar others? Similarity can be defined by gender, race, age, occupation, educational achievement, status, values, geographic proximity.. 

### Content(s)

What kind of content(s) are users producing, sharing and consuming on these networks?

### Currency

What do people *exchange* on the networks you chose?

For examples, `likes` are the currency on [Instagram](http://instagram.com), `retweets` and `followers` are [Twitter](https://twitter.com)'s currencies.

### Content definition

How are things called in your chosen social networks?

Is it `friends` or `contacts` or `buddies` or ... ?

Is it `like` or `love` or `appreciate` or `agree` or `+1` or ... ? 

And what implications could those choice of words have? For example, how do you `like` a post about a missing cat, or someone's death? Are all your connections really `friends`?

In particular, consider the **calls to action** (eg: `Buy this`, `Sign up today`, `Follow me`, `Send`, `Post` etc), which are usually found in buttons. What are your competitors asking users to do?

### Language

How do your competitors *talk* to their users, via texts and images?

Is the tone *formal* or *informal*, *plain* or *technical*, *sophisticated* or *unpretentious*, *active* or *passive*, etc.?

In what person do your competitors talk: `we`, `I`, `you`?

Is it `your profile` or `my profile`? 

What feelings do you think they are trying to trigger in the audience? 

### Onboarding

User *onboarding* is the process of increasing the likelihood that *new users* adopt your product and keep using it.

How do your chosen social networks onboard new users?

See these very good analyses of slightly confusing user onboarding: [Instagram](http://www.useronboard.com/how-instagram-onboards-new-users/) and [SnapChat](http://www.useronboard.com/how-snapchat-onboards-new-users/)

### Blank slate

> I just signed up, what do I do now?

Your app may feel without life and empty before the user has started to enter data into it. This is an opportunity to motivate the user to start using the app, by showing examples (sample content, screenshots) and best practices (seeds).

How do your chosen social networks deal with blank slates? How do they set the tone?
