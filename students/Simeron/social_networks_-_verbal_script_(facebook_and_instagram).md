## Social networks - verbal script (Facebook and Instagram)

###Queen Facebook: 
Magic mirror on the screen, who is the best social network of them all? 
	
###Magic Mirror Google:
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty. But hold, a lovely picture I see. Filters cannot hide her gentle grace. Alas, she has more likes than thee. 
	
###Queen Facebook: 
Alas for her! Reveal her name. 
	
###Magic Mirror Google: 
The like button as red as a rose. An increasingly high subscribtion rate . Skin white as snow. 
	
###Queen Facebook: 
Instagram!
*(she turns to her huntsman and says)*

###Queen Facebook:
Go and find this Instagram and bring her to me!

###Huntsman app store:
yes your majesty!
*(Huntsman finds instagram on the app store and tell her)*
	
###Huntsman:
Go run, Instagram, Queen Facebook is trying to keep you for herself! 
	
###Instagram: 
OMG thank you! 
	
*(Later when the huntsman gets back to the queen)*

###Huntsman:
I'm sorry queen I could not find Instagram 
	
###Queen Facebook: 
Typical! if you want a job doing, do it yourself!, I'm buying Instagram for $1billion in cash and stock! I'm taking it over 


The end :)
